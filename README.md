This PowerShell script requires you to enter in a few variables and will deploy a virtual machine in the Azure Resource Manager (new) Portal. It requires you to login and enter local administrator credentials for the machine. You will be prompted to enter these two sets of credentials unless you modify the below code.

Be sure to install the AzureRM module prior to trying to execute this code. NOTE: there is both an Azure Module and AzureRM module, one for each of the portals.
